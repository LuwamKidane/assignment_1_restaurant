				<h1><em>Our famous food</em></h1>
				<p>Your local restaurant is known for its outstanding selection of great American food!</p>
				<p>Our list of food is but not limited to...</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><!--added em--><em>Hamburger</em></p>
			</li>
		</ul>
				<p>Our hamburger is one of the greatest burgers of all time. Period. Nothing else needs to be said for how good it is!</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><!--added em--><em>Steak</em></p>
			</li>
		</ul>
				<p>Our steaks are made like steaks should be made. Medium rare is the longest we cook them. Every cut into the steak streams out the sweet-savory juice that makes them amazing!</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><!--added em--><em>Taco</em></p>
			</li>
		</ul>
				<p>Do you need something light to eat or are you in a hurry? Don't look farther than our tacos. You can add any toppings that we offer on your taco, making it one of the most popular items. Ask for a crunchy shell if you are feeling special or you can order it like a burrito.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><!--added em--><em>Meatloaf</em></p>
			</li>
		</ul>
				<p>Meatloaf is the way to go if you aren't sure what you want to eat tonight. With it being a homemade special, there is not any sauce that needs to go with it. The meatloaf is just that good.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p><!--added em--><em>Beverages</em></p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We offer both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Our rich and smooth tasting wines come from a family-owned vineyard in Califorina.  </p>
